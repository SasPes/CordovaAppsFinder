If the information isn't reviewed frequently, the learner will likely forget majority of the material. By using spaced repetition, Little Math Genius takes note of the time a learner started practicing a problem, scores the learner's problem performance, and sends reminders at an interval that will help sustain the memory of a lesson. The idea is that if a student solves a collection of problems over a long timespan, he/she will have a stronger grasp of the material learned.</p>\n<p>So why is Little Math Genius needed?\nThere is a emphasis on encouraging students to pursue careers in S.T.E.M related fields.

If you prefer not to use a library, we offer a public REST API, which provides all of the power of Thingdom via simple web calls.</p>\n<p>Some examples of usage include monitoring your web server and getting alerted when a particular event happens, posting progress data from you to Thingdom so you can easily track a long running job from your mobile device, and hooking into products like WordPress to get push notifications whenever a new user signs up or when a new comment is posted. With Thingdom, you can easily post feed messages whenever any action/event occurs in your web application, and any data that is available to your application can be exposed to Thingdom.

There is also a facility to record snippets of your performance and review them later to see where you need to improve, or reflect on how far you have come since the early days.</p>\n<p>Attractive, minimalist graphs show you just how much time you have spent on each piece in the past, and shows you any trends, as well as informing you of when you last practiced the piece.</p>\n<p>The app can also remind you on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis to revisit certain pieces to keep them fresh in your memory.</p>\n<p>Designed with a modern, slick, look and feel, and with the capability to store thousands of songs, MusicKata is the newest, most modern music practice journal available today.</p>", "weight": 21}, {"unique_key": "ce36b0a24ee17f637ba8", "android_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.gotack.tack", "ios_url": "https://itunes.apple.com/app/tack/id1021601097", "url": "http://www.gotack.co/", "ss2": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/ce36b0a24ee17f637ba8-IMG_0038.PNG?Signature=ex0DGY39UtPZzkcA6AQagBMrHEY%3D&Expires=1468718755&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "ss3": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/ce36b0a24ee17f637ba8-IMG_0044.PNG?Signature=gvHOxHjwBJhICyZGgMELxcXyLBA%3D&Expires=1468718755&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "author": "David Bellaiche", "ss1": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/ce36b0a24ee17f637ba8-IMG_0042.PNG?Signature=swPsSU2QKOt%2BdrF6W16limZLZJA%3D&Expires=1468718755&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "app_name": "Tack - Interact with your local area", "app_icon": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/ce36b0a24ee17f637ba8-1s%20artboard%20cropped.png?Signature=IhjesOCjv%2BQqOEWy37HOljQDYLk%3D&Expires=1468718755&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "created_at": "2016-01-16T00:55:08Z", "description": "<p>I am excited to show you our Ionic app called Tack.</p>\n<p>Tack is a mobile application based on geo-located message, which allows you to interact with people nearby.\nYou can speak with your neighbourhood, your classmate at the university, at the airport, or anywhere else.</p>\n<p>Highlights :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See what\u2019s happening around you</li>\n<li>Interact with your local area wherever you are : at university, at work, at the airport or on the beach</li>\n<li>You can share and discover insights from locals</li>\n<li>Follow places that matter to you and get notified when something happen</li>\n<li>Talk to small business in your neighbourhood</li>\n<li>Leave a trace anywhere in the world</li>\n<li>And many other amazing features to improve your local communication</li>\n</ul>", "weight": 21}, {"unique_key": "3e0d5ed32c8fbffaf087", "android_url": "", "ios_url": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mark-grade-elegantly/id1024878410", "url": "http://markapplication.com", "ss2": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/3e0d5ed32c8fbffaf087-screen2.jpg?Signature=Ip2fge16iQjfX%2BCrIG2EFTdocvA%3D&Expires=1468718755&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "ss3": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/3e0d5ed32c8fbffaf087-screen3.jpg?Signature=IJg5nwMIaXwDnN1fx188WIC5YHg%3D&Expires=1468718755&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "author": "Doug Niccum", "ss1": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/3e0d5ed32c8fbffaf087-screen1.jpg?Signature=AX1s3Orw7sYYXt%2Bx8d8zySNNMp0%3D&Expires=1468718755&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "app_name": "Mark - Grade Elegantly", "app_icon": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/3e0d5ed32c8fbffaf087-iTunesArtwork%402x.png?Signature=WgNgXkCk%2F8e950FxlO2w7e8bOWw%3D&Expires=1468718755&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "created_at": "2015-09-15T19:59:27Z", "description": "<p>As teachers, grading assignments holds a somewhat dark place in our heart.

You\u2019re not quite ready to go home, but have no idea what\u2019s still open around you.</p>\n<p>Or have you found yourself on a business trip, arriving late in an unfamiliar city, and just want to grab a bite to eat but don\u2019t know what's still open, or if it's going to be any good?</p>\n<p>WOTSOPEN is a handy app that can tell you just that.</p>\n<p>WOTSOPEN pulls in all available opening times of places around you and sorts them into 5 quick access categories: Eat, Drink, Shop, Get Cash, and Things (which covers museums, theatre, cinemas etc...).</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for something outside of the 5 main categories, then simply type the place name and location into search, for example: \u201cDumplings, Soho, New York\u201d and WOTSOPEN will do it's best to find this out, too.</p>\n<p>Results are listed in proximity, so if a place is on top of the list it\u2019s closer to your current location. And if you move about, just pull down the list and results will refresh based on your new location.</p>\n<p>WOTSOPEN not only shows you what\u2019s open right now but also serves up a 7 day view of opening times to help plan ahead. Really handy for weekend opening times that can vary a lot from regular Mon-Fri hours.</p>\n<p>A Call button has also been included for places that might not like sharing their opening hours. It does happen! Or perhaps you just want to call to be sure in case you\u2019re traveling a distance and want to make absolutely certain it\u2019s still open.</p>\n<p>This also comes in handy on public holidays. Not all places update their times for public holidays either so it\u2019s a good idea to call before trekking all the way across town only to be disappointed at the other end.</p>\n<p>So now you have a list of places nearby, how do you know what\u2019s actually good and worth trying out? Simply tap on reviews and see what other people had to say. They usually give a pretty good indication of what to expect.</p>\n<p>In the next release, WOTSOPEN will be integrating a \u2018Meet me there\u2019 button which let\u2019s your friends know where you\u2019re headed to next...</p>\n<p>But in the mean time have fun discovering what's open around you - and don\u2019t forget to store your favourite places so you don't have to keep asking when it opens, when it closes, or are they still open?</p>\n<p>For tips and other helpful information visit our website www.wotsopen.com and follow us via @wotsopen on Twitter.</p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re having any technical issues or have any questions or feedback, feel free to let us know at info@wotstopen.com</p>\n<p>Thanks from Team WO!</p>", "weight": 21}, {"unique_key": "53f1dceb84a407df0b00", "android_url": "", "ios_url": "https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=986957557&mt=8", "url": "http://startapplabs.com/", "ss2": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/53f1dceb84a407df0b00-iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%2021.4.2015%202.50.47.png?Signature=KrLZvfOM9bXS8xAG9fIHoprwfyo%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "ss3": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/53f1dceb84a407df0b00-iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%2021.4.2015%202.50.50.png?Signature=xpht3%2F9ImS1mRqGmamvLg3Z8SSk%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "author": "Dayana Jabif", "ss1": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/53f1dceb84a407df0b00-iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%2021.4.2015%202.50.36.png?Signature=9QJ8tVwpHIQUGGBcbJyYiF49aWU%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "app_name": "JSConfUY 2015", "app_icon": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/53f1dceb84a407df0b00-logo.png?Signature=eWcUbYT2dqCkf%2FIpSOeCNEQiH7U%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "created_at": "2015-04-28T02:20:22Z", "description": "<p>We made this app for the JSConfUY 2015.

In 2001, the UNESCO included Aragonese Mudejar art in the World Heritage list, highlighting that the Aljaferia palace is one of the most representative monuments of Mudejar art. It has become a symbol of Aragonese civil architecture and is probably one of the compulsory references of Spanish history and culture, evidenced by the more than three million visitors it has received since it was opened in the middle of the eighties of the last century.</p>\n<p>When our visitors enter the monument, they not only encounter the beautiful archways of the Islamic palace, which contrast with the impressive presence of the Troubadour tower, a space where Giuseppe Verdi developed part of his romantic action in the operetta, Il Trovatore, but they can also visit the mediaeval palace of the monarchs of Aragon, with its alfarjes (flat carved and decorated wooden ceiling with visible beams) that cover its rooms, or the part that was built over the northern wing of the Islamic enclosure by the Catholic Monarchs. Here, its amazing Throne Room with its spectacular coffered ceiling, made of carved, gilt and polychrome wood, can be seen.</p>\n<p>The Aljaferia has experienced different phases, changes and stages. Many Aragonese people still remember it as military barracks in the 20th century. But today, the final phase of the monument\u2019s restoration work has ended and it is now a live and open building, a cultural benchmark, which shows its long history and houses, within its walls, the institution that represents all the Aragonese people: The Cortes (parliament) of Aragon.</p>", "weight": 23}, {"unique_key": "8480027e332591993cae", "android_url": "", "ios_url": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lvlup/id1009050648?mt=8", "url": "http://twitter.com/josephocasioz", "ss2": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/8480027e332591993cae-2.png?Signature=HXMBnpnlT%2FZYh%2BIRM3Poo0d%2FBEU%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "ss3": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/8480027e332591993cae-3.png?Signature=jH53AGlBBpKw78qXI3aqVvAK0Jw%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "author": "Jose Ocasio", "ss1": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/8480027e332591993cae-1.png?Signature=GCjIOXiRGeC6fxoxojIWz%2BxKC20%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "app_name": "LvlUp", "app_icon": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/8480027e332591993cae-lll.PNG?Signature=KMVS9R%2FC%2Bj37Est0SjLjqSBovn8%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "created_at": "2015-07-28T19:31:18Z", "description": "<p>LvlUp makes your life more productive while making it fun!\nBe productive and start leveling up!</p>\n<p>Features:\n- Gain XP from completing tasks.\n- Level up!\n- Keep your day productive by tracking your daily productivity ratio.\n- Complete achievements for personal growth.\n- Simple and beautiful design.</p>", "weight": 23}, {"unique_key": "e4b0c7472b694fd6bfb3", "android_url": "https://goo.gl/8xH8Xv", "ios_url": "https://goo.gl/bLKpMH", "url": "http://propfolio.info", "ss2": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/e4b0c7472b694fd6bfb3-5.5_Screen_2.jpg?Signature=7Fpx%2Bh6OKkstu%2FEpqHsNkIycPTQ%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "ss3": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/e4b0c7472b694fd6bfb3-5.5_Screen_4.jpg?Signature=BM1QbAbq0JTTtOC7hP1ZVKUStM4%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "author": "Seaw Wei Liew", "ss1": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/e4b0c7472b694fd6bfb3-5.5_Screen_1.jpg?Signature=QVF8iPlOErrrZ1pO%2FeUUlkKoEl0%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "app_name": "Propfolio", "app_icon": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/e4b0c7472b694fd6bfb3-icon_1024x1024.jpg?Signature=UhEZ8WH6yV22Xwx6S6lfY5H3oyU%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "created_at": "2015-12-29T15:39:18Z", "description": "<p>Purchasing a home in this day and age is an expensive proposition.</p>\n<p>Be it buying your first home or looking to expand your portfolio, it's important to have a clear plan and investment strategy in place.</p>\n<p>PROPFOLIO provides handy tools to give you a better understanding of your current financial situation.</p>", "weight": 23}], [{"unique_key": "ad9f3df3a4ff3d7feeac", "android_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.gsgd.relocateto.capetown", "ios_url": "", "url": "http://gsgd.co.uk/relocate-to/cape-town", "ss2": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/ad9f3df3a4ff3d7feeac-arrival.png?Signature=C4kSWfj1EDdVFoF7NyUhP9yqlwE%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "ss3": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/ad9f3df3a4ff3d7feeac-settling.png?Signature=lyc06ZpMzEteQpEUrb7DmkXgOLY%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "author": "George McGinley Smith", "ss1": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/ad9f3df3a4ff3d7feeac-before.png?Signature=tOsggoxWFaXJLyA7MZTwnm7lpQs%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "app_name": "Relocate To Cape Town", "app_icon": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/ad9f3df3a4ff3d7feeac-icon.png?Signature=n0fEg0YVfdGUvoUm8Awhr7%2Bz0g4%3D&Expires=1468718756&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "created_at": "2015-05-24T20:31:22Z", "description": "<p>If you are planning on living and working in Cape Town you will no doubt have lots of questions and concerns about relocating and how it will impact on your life.

Go no further than the recent iCloud leak or the \u201cSnappening\u201d to prove that individuals need better control over their photos. </p>\n<p>Cloaks is a fun and easy way to protect sensitive photos from snooping eyes. When you Cloak a photo, it is split into pieces that are randomized to camouflage the caption. Each image is Cloaked using a different algorithm, meaning that the risk of hacking is very low.</p>\n<p>As opposed to competing solutions like PhotoVault or GalleryLock, Cloaks has been designed assuming that private images will occasionally end up in the wrong hands and be misused. This is why we manipulate the original image rather than simply mask or hide it in another location. Also, Cloaks never saves the original image, but only temporarily renders it on the screen by using key coordinates to reshuffle pieces back to their original position. The coordinates are stored on the device, but encrypted with one of the Advanced Encryption Standards and a PBKDF2 function. </p>\n<p>A beautiful side-effect of Cloaks is that it can be also used as a photo editing tool to create cool image art (\u201cCloakArt\u201d), check out our gallery at instagram.com/cloaks_app to see what we mean. </p>\n<p>Our goal is to set a cross-platform standard for shared sensitive content, starting with photos on social solutions like Snapchat, Whatsapp, Facebook etc. We are considering a collaboration with universities to develop the technique even further. </p>", "weight": 28}, {"unique_key": "afe4d2f1d9ec0e749af7", "android_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jitbit.helpdesk&hl=en", "ios_url": "https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/jitbit-helpdesk/id623820409?mt=8", "url": "http://jitbit.com/web-helpdesk/", "ss2": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/afe4d2f1d9ec0e749af7-screen568x568-1.jpeg?Signature=y4B53lQ5YHIQ31rPsnQjBgjp7sA%3D&Expires=1468718757&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "ss3": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/afe4d2f1d9ec0e749af7-screen568x568-2.jpeg?Signature=Y9rK2rntDRuv%2FKGINYarIIgyRxQ%3D&Expires=1468718757&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "author": "Max Al Farakh", "ss1": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/afe4d2f1d9ec0e749af7-screen568x568.jpeg?Signature=HY0vcIWHoF3XqOi4eAM6eS%2BnKVU%3D&Expires=1468718757&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "app_name": "Jitbit Helpdesk", "app_icon": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/afe4d2f1d9ec0e749af7-Icon-60%403x.png?Signature=AwU1UVeTrqz6%2BPmTH0ui%2BnXy1tw%3D&Expires=1468718757&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "created_at": "2014-11-06T16:31:08Z", "description": "<p>This app is companion for our help desk web app called Jitbit Helpdesk.

No stalking here! People in general want more privacy, and we intend to give it to them.</p>\n<p>Besides all that it's just really fun to use.

It's like that game, Akinator, except that it's with real people!</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY\n20 Questions is a turn-based game where a player (the Thinker) thinks of something and then gives a hint. Others (the Guessers) will ask questions and try to guess what the Thinker is thinking. If the Guessers get it right within 20 attempts, they win, otherwise, the Thinker wins. That's it--it's so simple that even grandma can join in the fun!</p>\n<p>SCORING\nGuessers get 1 point for each question asked for which the answer is YES or SOMETIMES. The Guesser who makes the correct guess also gets an additional 20 bonus points, plus x bonus points where x is the number of remaining questions. The Thinker gets 1 point for each question asked for which the answer is NO. The Thinker also gets an additional 20 bonus points if the Guessers don't get it right within 20 attempts. So, a player (whether Guesser or Thinker) can score a maximum of 39 points on any given game.</p>\n<p>Games have a powerful way of bringing family and friends together. Forty years ago this meant families joining together at game night to play Risk or Monopoly. In recent years, Words with Friends, Draw Something, Trivia Crack and others have created opportunities for bonding with friends and family. With 20 Questions, we have taken the world\u2019s most widely recognized guessing game, and adapted it for play on the social platform. There have been versions of this game where you play with the computer as your opponent, but we are the first to bring this classic guessing game to your social network, where you can play with real people, in real time.</p>\n<p>20 Questions is intellectually simulating, highly addictive and engaging, and is a great workout for the growing youngster's brain. Start playing now and let's see how soon you can become a top ten guesser or thinker!</p>\n<p>Play 20 Questions online at http://20questions.com\nFollow us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/20questions\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/20questions\nEmail us at team@20questions.com</p>", "weight": 31}, {"unique_key": "d51cfd44c97e222bfe7e", "android_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.saite.store&hl=pt_BR", "ios_url": "", "url": "http://www.gruposaite.com.br/", "ss2": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/d51cfd44c97e222bfe7e-foto2.png?Signature=ClN9cjlspDmjKNenD%2FWJhASKAUY%3D&Expires=1468718757&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "ss3": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/d51cfd44c97e222bfe7e-foto3.png?Signature=3ZNaGkzDcoexJKNYWdTNnxXvTqA%3D&Expires=1468718757&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "author": "Grupo SAITE", "ss1": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/d51cfd44c97e222bfe7e-foto1.png?Signature=MSbL4Oq7gItRSgo6oZwVGcYLKxM%3D&Expires=1468718757&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "app_name": "SAITE Store", "app_icon": "https://ionic-showcase.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/d51cfd44c97e222bfe7e-saitestorelogo.png?Signature=v%2B43%2FLRuPXHxtQQq5mUaS2%2FU7GQ%3D&Expires=1468718757&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDCP7OJIJTR4UCWQ", "created_at": "2015-11-09T19:38:25Z", "description": "<p>SAITE Store \u00e9 a loja virtual desenvolvida pelo Grupo Saite que disponibiliza diversos e-books (livros eletr\u00f4nicos interativos) para dispositivos m\u00f3veis, categorizados em \u00e1reas tem\u00e1ticas, e com lan\u00e7amentos cont\u00ednuos.
